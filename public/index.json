Then when deploying the helm charts, each chart would self-reference in the _helpers.tpl, NOTES.txt, and stateful sets/deployment/service yamls. This was a source of some frustration attributable to the following:\n Too many files Pipeline updates cannot be version controlled on one values yaml Observability on Declarative platforms (such as argo)  Initially, our ARGO dash appeared as if there were many unrelated applications running:\nAfter combining the helm charts into one, with a handy script I wrote, our ARGO setup appeared beautifully as this:\nNow, not only do we have the option of rolling back using the kubernetes controller, but we could roll back the values yaml itself to prior versions.\nWe instead set up the gitlab runner to go into the unified-helm chart repository and update the values yaml each time a release was tagged in the source repos by any of our engineers.\nSo the lesson is: Unless otherwise required, wield helm in a manner that is most powerful for your team and your infrastructure.\nMark\n","date":"12","image":"images/helm.png","month":"May","permalink":"https://gantry.cloud/post/unihelm/","tags":["Dev-Ops"],"title":"UniHelm"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Jason Stryker is a Site Reliability Engineer who has worked on cloud migrations and critical infrastructure automation for a major banking institution.\n","date":"01","image":"","month":"Jan","permalink":"https://gantry.cloud/author/jason-stryker/","tags":null,"title":"Jason Stryker"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Mark Wagner is a Full Stack Linux engineer based in Austin, Texas who previously automated Machine Learning efforts at Wells Fargo.\n","date":"01","image":"","month":"Jan","permalink":"https://gantry.cloud/author/mark-wagner/","tags":null,"title":"Mark Wagner"},{"categories":["services"],"contents":"Enhanced Kubernetes Managed and self-hosted options available\nEnhanced CI/CD Managed and self-hosted options available\nSo Kubernetes is your destination, great choice!
