Are your engineers on google? GCloud!
Maybe you need your own control planes altogether!</description>

      <description>Day Zero: Your team has decided that it is time to move virtual. There are questions whose answers only create more questions. What platform? Which Software? Who will handle it? What if it breaks? And most critical: What if we lose critical data? Start at the beginning and follow the map.</description>

      <title>Kustomize</title>

      <description>How do Kustomize and Helm Compare? Â Helm and Kustomize are two tools that allow users to create custom Linux-based OS stacks for cloud environments. The only difference between these two is in how they work with Docker containers. Kustomize builds on top of a base image, whereas Helm creates a new container instance from scratch. Kustomize does not have built-in support for using Docker images as templates, but has an ability to use any other tool such as Ansible or Chef.</description>

      <description>Unifying your helm.. is it a good idea?
So you have twenty microservices floating around with their own values files, stateful sets, service yamls and possibly even pulling from isolated sources of secrets.
This can be hard to maintain, depending on your CI pipeline due to the fact that each values file needs to have its versions modified every time a new container is made, tagged and pushed to the repository.</description>
