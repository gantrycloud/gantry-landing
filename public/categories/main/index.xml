      <description>Straddled over a shipyard, a Gantry Crane is used to organize containers, and is capable of lifting the heaviest loads on the planet. In our increasingly automated world, infrastructure is code, software is containerized, and storage is cloud based. Your business has deadlines, objectives and assets that need to get places on time, every time. Let us do the heavy lifting. â€“ Gantry</description>

      <description>Why not declarative? Have you ever written a deploy script to push your Kubernetes Helm chart yamls up to the cluster one by one?

ArgoCD is a powerful tool that runs in your cluster and grabs everything it needs from github/gitlab including:
 Container Repository Locations Helm Charts Latest Tags  It then executes the helm command as a &amp;ldquo;sync&amp;rdquo; in your cluster and puts it all together in a beautiful visual graph.</description>
