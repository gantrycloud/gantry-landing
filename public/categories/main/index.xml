      <description>   Lets get seven points clear:  Argo is a free, open-source continuous deployment tool It&amp;rsquo;s designed to be easy to use and deploy with any language or framework It works by running commands on your servers as you push new code to GitHub You can configure it for automatic deployments using web hooks from GitHub or BitBucket When deploying, Argo will run tests before updating the server if necessary If tests fail, then no changes are made and the previous version of the app remains deployed until you manually update it yourself (or fix the tests) Argo also has an option for staging environments that let you test out new features before they go live in production  </description>

      <description>Why not declarative? Have you ever written a deploy script to push your Kubernetes Helm chart yamls up to the cluster one by one?
Maybe you do this manually and then have the misfortune of having to do it all over once more when something breaks.
ArgoCD is a powerful tool that runs in your cluster and grabs everything it needs from github/gitlab including:
 Container Repository Locations Helm Charts Latest Tags  It then executes the helm command as a &amp;ldquo;sync&amp;rdquo; in your cluster and puts it all together in a beautiful visual graph.</description>
