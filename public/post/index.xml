      <description>   Lets get seven points clear:  Argo is a free, open-source continuous deployment tool It&amp;rsquo;s designed to be easy to use and deploy with any language or framework It works by running commands on your servers as you push new code to GitHub You can configure it for automatic deployments using web hooks from GitHub or BitBucket When deploying, Argo will run tests before updating the server if necessary If tests fail, then no changes are made and the previous version of the app remains deployed until you manually update it yourself (or fix the tests) Argo also has an option for staging environments that let you test out new features before they go live in production  </description>

      <description>Straddled over a shipyard, a Gantry Crane is used to organize containers, and is capable of lifting the heaviest loads on the planet. In our increasingly automated world, infrastructure is code, software is containerized, and storage is cloud based. Your business has deadlines, objectives and assets that need to get places on time, every time. Let us do the heavy lifting. â€“ Gantry</description>

      <description>Day Zero: Your team has decided that it is time to move virtual. There are questions whose answers only create more questions. What platform? Which Software? Who will handle it? What if it breaks? And most critical: What if we lose critical data? Start at the beginning and follow the map.</description>

      <description>Decision Making How do you decide what cloud is for you?
Do you need compliance? Perhaps you are leaning towards Azure.
Are your engineers on google? GCloud!
Maybe you need your own control planes altogether!</description>

      <title>Argo CD</title>

      <description>Why not declarative? Have you ever written a deploy script to push your Kubernetes Helm chart yamls up to the cluster one by one?
Maybe you do this manually and then have the misfortune of having to do it all over once more when something breaks.
ArgoCD is a powerful tool that runs in your cluster and grabs everything it needs from github/gitlab including:
 Container Repository Locations Helm Charts Latest Tags  It then executes the helm command as a &amp;ldquo;sync&amp;rdquo; in your cluster and puts it all together in a beautiful visual graph.</description>

      <description>Unifying your helm.. is it a good idea?
So you have twenty microservices floating around with their own values files, stateful sets, service yamls and possibly even pulling from isolated sources of secrets.
This can be hard to maintain, depending on your CI pipeline due to the fact that each values file needs to have its versions modified every time a new container is made, tagged and pushed to the repository.</description>
