You've probably heard of Nginx, right? It's one of the most popular web servers in use today. But have you ever heard of Caddy Server? It's a relatively new server that is quickly growing in popularity because it offers many benefits over other traditional web servers. In this blog post we will explore some reasons why Caddy Server might be better for your website than Nginx..

Caddy is an excellent open source, autonomous web server written in GO that provides reverse proxies, automatic SSL certificates and more. Caddy has no external dependencies so it's lightweight and easy to install. It can handle about 200 simultaneous connections on a single core of CPU with 1G RAM.

Caddy means no more messing around with LetsEncrypt, no more Nginx debugging, and higher performance. [Find out if if Caddy is right for you here at the docs!](https://caddyserver.com/)

And also, check out the source here on the creator, [Matt Holt's Github](https://github.com/mholt).
