Your infrastructure scalability needs now go beyond what can be accomplished with docker-compose. We will build your helm charts and give you a documented process for setting up your infrastructure on a cloud provider such as Gcloud, AWS, DigitalOcean or Azure.

What we provide:
- Main.tf file tailored to create the resources for your services (load balancers, clusterIPs, Pods)
- Unified or volumed helm charts templating your deployments  
- Deployment script to launch those services in a kubernetes cluster
- Prometheus dashboard installed to view your status  
- Documentation on how to recreate and maintain system

Don't push code to your cluster, have your cluster intelligently pull it instead!
Have a push-button deployment for up to 20 microservices done for you.
We give existing Kubernetes or Container based environment an ArgoCD continuous delivery backbone so that every time your code in changes in dev, test or production; your applications will update instantly. You just decide what triggers to set off the synchronization.

What we provide:
- ArgoCD setup that installs in your cluster and syncs latest images from your container repository as soon as they are built (usually upon tagging in your CI pipeline)
- Scripts to launch this repeatably and efficiently.
- Optional Argo Rollouts and Argo Workflows (Additional)

Are you a bank or a business that requires the highest privacy measures?
You can't use a cloud provider, but you want to use all the best available open source tools.
You need your own control plane (kubeadm) and we will build this for you and educate your team on how to operate it.

What we provide:
- Kubernetes control plane running on bare metal or virtual machine.
- Basic cluster setup on the machine
- Documentation and support on how to modify, migrate and scale your custom environment.
